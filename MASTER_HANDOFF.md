# Architecture AI Agent — Master Handoff

## Purpose
Durable repository-backed continuation point for Architecture AI Agent.

## Non-negotiable governance
1. Do not redo completed work unless regression evidence requires it.
2. Implement the current stage.
3. Run the **real CI workflow** for the current commit.
4. Verify actual status/conclusion; queued/running/failed/unobserved is not green.
5. Run required regression checks when applicable.
6. Persist verified state in the repository.
7. Green Gate requires real CI `completed / success` plus required verification/regression evidence.
8. Do not start the next gated H until the current gate has real evidence.
9. **Notion is excluded from governance and execution.**
10. Never convert Logical/Static PASS or UNKNOWN evidence into Real Runtime/Visual PASS.
11. **No-Wait / Forward-Motion Rule:** investigate blockers immediately; safe parallel preparation is allowed only when it does not invalidate the active gate or violate dependencies.

## Architecture principles
- This is not an image editor.
- Controlled editing must understand architectural plan logic.
- Source of Truth: PlanModel + ConstraintMap + ApprovedChangePlan.
- Pipeline: prompt → understanding → ChangeRequest → PlanModel → ConstraintMap → ImpactAnalysis → Rules → ChangeProposal → Conflict → Validation → ApprovedChangePlan → Controlled Editing → PostEditDiff → Final Validation → Audit.
- Unknown/insufficient evidence fails closed.

## Current verified continuation point — H100 input-source boundary

- H99 — Architectural Relations is merged on main: `2344e1083937e5d91857ba24b6a0f077414f06ca`.
- PR #65 Feature-to-File Matrix + semantic-chain research is merged: `176bc2ceb330e2987891ef6edbbaf33b73dc77d3`.
- PR #65 pre-merge gates: PR CI #138, Runtime #425, Bug Hunt #96 — completed/success.
- Post-merge main gates on `176bc2c`: Runtime #427, PR CI #140, Bug Hunt #97 — completed/success.
- H100 is now active on branch `feat/h100-input-source-boundary`.
- Implemented boundary: Image Input remains supported but is separate from Engineering Plan Input.
- Geometry evidence hierarchy: **DWG/DXF → Vector PDF → Raster PDF → JPG/PNG/WEBP**.
- PDF must be classified by evidence as vector or raster; unknown representation remains fail-closed.
- `runtime/input_source_contract.py` defines the source classes and trust ordering.
- `runtime/request_contract.py` carries optional `source_profile` metadata.
- H100 is **not complete yet**. Remaining drawing-semantics/evidence work must be implemented, tested, Bug-Hunted, regression-verified and persisted before merge.

## Consolidated architecture baseline
### Product
- Architecture AI Agent MVP; provider-neutral, low-cost/open-source oriented, Iran-friendly, tablet/PWA friendly.
- MVP supports image/document inputs, but the architecture now distinguishes Engineering Plan Input from Image Input.
- Source hierarchy for geometry reconstruction: DWG/DXF → Vector PDF → Raster PDF → JPG/PNG/WEBP.
- Native DWG/DXF editing remains outside the current MVP editing boundary; Golden DWGs remain regression assets.
- Golden DWGs: `bagheri7.dwg`, `afifiiiii.end.edit3.dwg`.

### Source of Truth and pipeline
- Source of Truth: PlanModel + ConstraintMap + ApprovedChangePlan.
- Pipeline: Prompt → Understanding → ChangeRequest → PlanModel → ConstraintMap → Impact → Rules → Proposal → Conflict → Validation → ApprovedChangePlan → Controlled Editing → Diff → Final Validation → Audit.

### Safety / fail-closed
- LOCKED / EDITABLE / CONDITIONAL / UNKNOWN.
- UNKNOWN / SOURCE_REQUIRED / NEEDS_REVIEW / ABSTAIN / BLOCKED.
- No uncertainty may become PASS.
- Logical, Runtime, and Visual PASS are separate.
- Protected MVP elements: columns, outer boundary, walls, doors, windows, overall plan form.

### BIM and plan understanding
- H98 is the deterministic Detection → PlanModel Reconstruction → ConstraintMap integration boundary.
- PlanModel remains evidence-backed and source-bound.
- BIM-ready semantic contracts provide identity and validated relations without making full IFC/BIM a runtime dependency.
- BIM must remain provider/software neutral and fail-closed.
- Future H stages must be derived from actual repository contracts, tests, and dependencies.

### Knowledge / rules
- Future Rule/Validation layers should incorporate traceable Iran building regulations, Engineering Organization/local rules, relevant نشریه 55/246/256, accessibility/façade/MEP rules, ISO 128/129-1/5457/7200, Neufert, Metric Handbook, Time-Saver, vocational drafting references, and CAD/BIM/Revit conventions.
- Keep rule sources separate from raw detection and make rules explicit/testable.

### Governance
- Implement → REAL CI → Verify → Regression → Persist → Continue.
- Exact-head `completed / success` is required for GREEN.
- Bug Hunting is mandatory after red tests.
- No-Wait Rule permits safe parallel preparation but never bypasses a gate.
- “بکاپ بگیر” is additive from the current point and never resets the project.
- Repository is durable recovery state; Notion is not governance.
- Auto-Runner should keep forward motion while respecting all gates.

## Golden / regression integrity
- Golden DWG assets must remain preserved.
- No destructive history reset.
- Real DWG regression remains a validation boundary.
- Visual Runtime remains separate from logical/static reconstruction.

## Continuation after H99 / PR #65

1. H99 is complete and post-merge main CI is GREEN.
2. Finish H100 from the actual repository contracts and tests.
3. Keep PDF representation evidence-driven; never guess vector/raster.
4. Preserve one canonical PlanModel/evidence chain; do not create duplicate semantic graphs.
5. Run REAL CI + Bug Hunt + required regression on the H100 head.
6. Persist verified state, then continue to H101 only after Green Gate evidence.


## Integrated research checkpoint — 2026-10-08

The project now carries forward the latest research without changing the Source of Truth.

### Research-derived architecture rules
- Use JMU-style explicit relations, RedrawAI-style staged raster reconstruction/uncertainty, Draftly-style semantic-intent-to-deterministic-geometry separation, CraftBot-style knowledge/feedback loops, and dwg-bim_AI-style CV→CAD/BIM bridging only as implementation patterns.
- YQArch/AutoCAD belongs behind a future Capability Registry / Execution Adapter. It is not the semantic authority.
- Do not allow arbitrary LISP or direct LLM-generated AutoCAD geometry to bypass PlanModel, ApprovedChangePlan and validation.
- Treat Iranian drawing conventions as semantic evidence: symbols, orientation, line weights/layers, dimensions, level codes, floor/stair relations, section/elevation markers and directions, cut planes, hatch, scale/unit and title-block metadata.
- Section markers/direction are semantic relations; level codes can constrain floor and vertical-circulation reasoning when evidence is complete and consistent.

### Current invariant
**Understanding the plan comes before generating or editing the plan.**

### Current H100 work
Finish source provenance/evidence binding, drawing-language semantics, contradiction/missing-evidence handling, fail-closed propagation and Golden DWG regression. H100 is not Green until exact-head REAL CI, Bug Hunt and required regression evidence are completed/successful.
